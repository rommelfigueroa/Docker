If you have an error that makes your container instantly exit
it is an issue with the Dockerfile.

In order to fix this you must rebuild the image

# Remove old containers
docker container prune 

# Remove old image
docker rmi IMAGENAME

# build image
docker build -t TAGNAME .

# run the image
docker run -d -p 5000:5000 CONTAINERID
